# Android Code

Here is the Android application that used to test the computational cost and battery consumption for our proposed method and other state-of-arts pruning methods.

All model and test data are located in assets folder. For all dataset, we use 200 test samples to evaluate the compuational cost and 2000 test samples to evaluate the battery consumption.

We adopt Batterystats and Battery Historian (https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/power/setup-battery-historian) to estimate the battary usage for each model.

Here is the Application UI:
